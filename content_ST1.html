        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>The world is on the brink of a climate catastrophe and current actions and plans to address the crisis are insufficient. Without transformative action starting now and within this decade to reduce greenhouse gas emissions deeply and rapidly in all sectors, the 1.5°C target will be at risk and with it the lives of more than 3 billion people. Failure to act leads to intensifying heatwaves, droughts, flooding, wildfires, sea-level rise, and famines. Emissions should already be decreasing now and will need to be cut almost by half by 2030 - a mere seven years from now. To combat climate change and its impacts by 2030, urgent and transformative action is needed to meet the commitments under the Paris Agreement across mitigation and adaptation efforts.</p>

        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <img src="istockphoto-1405880267-612x612.jpg" alt="Businesses and Investors Call">

        <p>Over 100 businesses and investors signed a joint letter calling on the EU to set a greenhouse emissions reduction target of at least 90% by 2040. In an open letter coordinated by CLG Europe, CEOs, leading businesses, investors, networks and SMEs across the EU, call on the EU to set a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least 90% by 2040.</p>

        <p>This science-based target reflects the urgency and benefits of near-term action. Businesses and investors stress that a robust target will bring economic opportunities and competitiveness benefits while increasing energy security for citizens and businesses. They argue that the target, and climate more broadly, should be considered as a central element of the EU’s overall strategy to achieve these objectives.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Integrate the target into a comprehensive industrial strategy, guided by a ‘competitive sustainability’ approach, allowing the EU to lead the global race of development of sustainable industrial ecosystems and industries.</li>
            <li>Place the target at the centre of the EU’s overall strategy to enhance energy security by accelerating the clean energy transition and energy efficiency, and phasing out fossil fuels.</li>
            <li>Build on the legacy of the Green Deal and effective implementation of the Fit for 55 Package.</li>
            <li>Harness the opportunities presented by the circular economy and eco-design to tackle emissions stemming from the production of materials.</li>
            <li>Create a clear signal to businesses and national governments of the importance in investing in nature-based solutions and the transition to a nature positive economy.</li>
            <li>Set a robust target that will allow the EU to play a leading role to phase out fossil fuels, triple the rate of deployment of renewables and double energy efficiency rates globally.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The letter states that businesses and investors stand ready to play a key role in translating climate targets into concrete action, working hand in hand with policymakers.</p>

        <p>Lars Petersson, CEO of VELUX, said: "To be ready for 2050, we need a 2040 EU emission reduction target of at least 90%. A significant part of this reduction needs to come from the building sector, which currently accounts for over a third of GHG emissions. At VELUX, by 2030, we aim to achieve a 100% reduction of operational emissions (scope 1 and 2) and reduce our carbon emissions from our value chain by 50% (scope 3). To get there, we collaborate closely with our whole value chain to create low carbon, energy efficient and healthy buildings.”</p>
